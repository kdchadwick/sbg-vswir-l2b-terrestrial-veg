This is Version 1.0 of the SBG VSWIR terrestrial vegetation algorithms for top of canopy traits.

## 2 Introduction

The NAS 2017 Decadal Survey called for a new generation of satellite missions to address critical science questions related to the Earth's surface and interior. The Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission was one of the missions recommended in the Decadal Survey. The SBG mission is designed to address key science questions related to the Earth's surface and interior, including the carbon cycle, terrestrial vegetation dynamics, and the water cycle. The mission is comprised of two satellite projects, the visible to shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer (VSWIR) Project and the thermal infrared (TIR) Project. This document describes the algorithm theoretical basis for the VSWIR terrestrial vegetation canopy surface trait products that are tracable to satisfying the science needs outlined in the Decadal Survey. 

This ATBD will cover the product generation for all terrestrial vegetation algorithms that are generated using a partial least squares regression (PLSR) framework. At the time of writing, this will include the following properties estimated for the phtosyntheic vegetation canopy surface observable from the VSWIR instrument: foliar nitrogen (N), leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf water content (LWC). These products are generalized into a single ATBD because they use a similar algorithmic framework and are generated using the same input data.
 
## 3 Context/Background

The PLSR derived terrestrial vegetation properties are situated in the larger context of the SBG VSWIR algorithm pipeline. The full algorithm pipeline can be seen in Figure 1 below.

This pipeline is the expected framework as of the time of writing, but is subject to change as the mission progresses.

### 4.1 Scientific Theory
These algorithms are intended to estimate the trait values of the green vegetation in the plant canopies that are within a pixel. While some pixels will be comprised of 100% photosynthetic vegetation (PV), many pixels will be mixed with other surface types. The PLSR algorithm is designed to estimate the trait values for the PV fraction of the pixel. The PLSR algorithm is trained on a large dataset of field measurements of the traits of interest and the corresponding reflectance spectra. The algorithm is trained to find the linear combination of the reflectance spectra that best predicts the trait values. The algorithm is then applied to the reflectance spectra of the pixels in the VSWIR image to estimate the trait values. These algorithms have been developed on a one off basis to date within specific study areas across different ecosystems, with different sensors and processing pipelines, and at different ground sampling distance (GSD). The SBG VSWIR project will have to aggregate appropriate datasets from existing studies and develop a new set of algorithms that can be applied to the SBG VSWIR data.

There are a variety of challenges to overcome in order to develop these algorithms, which the terrestrial vegetation algorithm working group is working to address. As of Q1 2025 the working group is focused on the following challenges and we will update this document as the project progresses.  

- **Bringing together existing field and airborne datasets.** We're developing a database of field and airborne datasets that can be used to train and validate the algorithms. This includes datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) program supported activities, including and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). A large challenge in this aggregation effort is that different platforms utilize different atmospheric correction and reflectance retrieval algorithms, which can lead to differences in the reflectance spectra. We are looking to start from radiance data rather than reflectance data to avoid these issues. However, this requires a good deal of work to re-extract data from flightlines and processing pixel level radiance to consistent reflectance data. 

- **Strategies for trait value aggregation from in situ collections to pixel resolution.** There are a variety of ways that a canopy trait value for a particular pixel can be determined from in situ data. There are also questions about if the goal is to estimate the value of PV traits per pixel, ignoring the non-PV fraction, or if the goal is to estimate the value of PV traits for the area of the pixel, setting non-PV cover to a value of zero. We are baselining the former scenario. The diagram below highlights the differences in aggregation approaches that could be utilized. ![img.png](figs/PlotLevelAggregationConsiderations.png) **Figure 3.** _Outline of various aggregation methods for canopy foliar traits._  
 
- **Determining which pixels will have the PLSR algorithms applied.** The PLSR algorithms are designed to estimate the trait values for the PV fraction of the pixel. The algorithms will only be applied to pixels that have a PV fraction above a certain threshold. The working group is currently working on determining the appropriate threshold for SBG VSWIR data utilizing data from the SHIFT project. There is a placeholder in section 4.4 for the threshold value. _note: it may be necessary to apply different fractional cover constraints depending on the other cover types present - onging work is considering scenarios where backgroud is bare surfaces of varying mineral compositions, non-photosynthentic vegetation, and standing water_

- **Scaling from airborne to spaceborne.** The algorithms have been developed on airborne data, which often has a much higher spatial resolution than the planned GSD of SBG VSWIR. The working group is assessing methods for scaling trait models to coarser GSDs by leveraging EMIT as a precursor. This scaling may include developing a method to aggregate the airborne data to the SBG VSWIR pixel size and utilizing those data to train the coarser resolution PLSR algorithms.

Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)

Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) is a multivariate statistical method used to model relationships between input variables (predictors) and output variables (responses). It is particularly useful when the predictors are highly collinear or when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations - both of these conditions are often met with VSWIR imaging spectroscopy data. PLSR projects both the predictor (reflectance) and response (trait) variables to a new space to extract relevant information. PLSR aims to find latent components that maximize the covariance between the predictor matrix. 

#### 4.2.1 Mathematical theory assumptions
When applying PLSR, the following assumptions are typically made:

- Linearity: The relationships between predictor variables and response variables are assumed to be linear.
- Latent Structure: PLSR assumes that there is a low-dimensional latent structure capturing most of the covariance between predictors and responses.
- Multicollinearity: PLSR is effective under the assumption that multicollinearity exists among predictors.
- Noise and Error: Measurement errors and noise are assumed to be present, but they should not dominate the relationship between variables.
- Sufficient Data: While PLSR can handle cases where $p > n$, having sufficient data for reliable component extraction is beneficial.

### 4.3 Algorithm Input Variables

The input variables for terrestrial vegetation PLSR products are: isofit corrected reflectance and uncertianty (L2a), fractional cover and uncertianty (L2b_FRAC).  

### 4.4 Algorithm Output Variables

Output variables for foliar nitrogen, leaf mass per area, and leaf water content are generated for each pixel in the input data with a fractional cover >= 0.XX photosynthetic vegetation. For all other pixels, the output is set to NaN. Units are as follows: foliar nitrogen (g N/g of dry foliar mass), leaf mass per area (g dry mass/m^2 of leaf area), and leaf water content (g water/g fresh foliage). Uncertianties are also generated for each output variable in the same units as the output variable.

## 5 Algorithm Usage Constraints
The algorithms will be developed with the datasets avaliable to the team. There are not currently any plans for SBG VSWIR to fund _in situ_ data collection activities due to budget constraints. Therefore the algorithms will be most appropriate for interpretation within the regions where there are training data available. This ATBD will contain a map and list of the regions that have training data for users to assess the likely reliability in their region of interest. The SBG VSWIR terrestrial vegetation team is working to compile a series of protocols for the community to use in support of improving the VSWIR terrestial vegetation algorithms. The team anticipates working with the community to gather the largest possible training dataset and will continue to update the PLSR coefficients as new data become available.

## 6 Performance Assessment
The terrestrial vegetation algorithms are part of the demonstration product suite that will be provided by SBG VSWIR. These products will be spot verified as possible post-launch. The team will do the best performance assessment possible with the data available. The models used here will be parameterized using the SBG-PLANTS database, which is being assembled leveraging data collections from SHIFT, NEON, EnSPEC, ABOVE, CHESS, AVUELO, and others as they become avaliable. Please be in touch if you have datasets that you believe could improve our algorithms and introduce sources of data from new ecoregions or bolster the datasets we already have. This platform is intended to be a community resource.
